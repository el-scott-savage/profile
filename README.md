 about me
 # 💫 About Me:
 I am beginning at the beginning, and I have been learning HTML and CSS. I think that I am aiming towards UI/UX programming, but there is a lot of space ahead of me. Fortunately, I am engaged with the content, syntax, and processes. Personally, I am reinventing myself and my relation to the workforce. Like so many over the past few years, I have needed to make some revisions to my life plan. So, here I am. This is another iteration of me, a freshly molted animal in all it's vulnerability. I welcome your suggestions because I am essentially a blank page at this stage.
