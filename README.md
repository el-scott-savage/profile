 # 💫 About Me:
I am reinventing my relationship to industry by learning HTML, CSS, Terminal/Git, Visual Studio, and GitHub. I am currently interested UI/UX development, but there is a lot of space ahead of me. Fortunately, I am engaged with the content, syntax, and processes. Like so many over the past few years, I have needed to make some revisions to my life plan. So, here I am. Learning.
